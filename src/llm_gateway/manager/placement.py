"""Placement rules (pure functions over a `rig observe` snapshot, the leases and the claims).

- A card is available only if no lease holds it, nothing runs on it (no llama container, VRAM
  nearly empty), and it is unclaimed, or claimed by the claim the request names.
- `gpus_needed` entries are {"min_vram_mb": N} with optional {"max_vram_mb": M}; each takes the
  smallest available card that fits, so big cards stay free for requests that need them.
- The port is 11434 + the lowest GPU index in the placement (the rig's existing convention). A
  lease reserves 11434 + every GPU it holds, so two leases can never get the same port.
