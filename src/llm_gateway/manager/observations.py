"""What the manager has seen the rig do: the gateway's own history, and its lessons file for benchmarking.

Every load the manager places is one row in `lessons/load_observations.jsonl` in this repo, committed like any
other file, so the history carries across sessions and machines. The manager learns from it (`fit.compute_mb`,
`fit.overhead_mb`, `fit.growth_margin_mb`, `fit.failed_ceiling`, and measured placement); benchmarking reads it when it wants to learn from real loads (the
other direction is the importer, tools/generate_profiles.py). Nothing here reads another repo. Kinds:

- `load`: a ready load. Model, GGUF, micro-batch, use, the cards by UUID with their link and root port (the
  rig's scan), the manager's estimate per card, what llama.cpp allocated per card (the rig's `fit`), memory in
  use per card once serving (nvidia-smi), and the load time.
- `load_failed`: a load the rig refused or that never served, with the same facts, the error and whether it ran
  out of memory: the other side of the fit boundary.
- `placement` identifies GPU-only or RAM partial offload. RAM rows are retained as evidence but are excluded
  from full-GPU memory calibration and OOM ceilings.

- `depth_memory`: full-depth memory growth for a GGUF and card-size layout.
- `performance`: prefill and decode rates for a GGUF, runtime image, context and card set.

Rows without `kind` are loads. Runtime coordination (the manager's requests, the orchestration's handling) is
not kept here, only what a later session should know.
